    "- Find other lists of hot songs on the internet and scrape them too: having a bigger pool of songs will be awesome!\n",
    "- Apply the same logic to other \"groups\" of songs: the best songs from a decade or from a country / culture / language / genre.\n",
    "- Wikipedia maintains a large collection of lists of songs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_songs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice web scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, scraping the internet is a skill that can get you all sorts of information. Here are some little challenges that you can try to gain more experience in the field:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve an arbitrary Wikipedia page of \"Python\" and create a list of links on that page: `url ='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python'`\n",
    "- Find the number of titles that have changed in the United States Code since its last release point: `url = 'http://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml'`\n",
    "- Create a Python list with the top ten FBI's Most Wanted names: `url = 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten'`\n",
    "- Display the 20 latest earthquakes info (date, time, latitude, longitude and region name) by the EMSC as a pandas dataframe: `url = 'https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/'`\n",
    "- List all language names and number of related articles in the order they appear in [wikipedia.org](wikipedia.org): `url = 'https://www.wikipedia.org/'`\n",
    "- A list with the different kind of datasets available in [data.gov.uk](data.gov.uk): `url = 'https://data.gov.uk/'`\n",
